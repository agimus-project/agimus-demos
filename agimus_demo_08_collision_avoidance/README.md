AGIMUS demo 08 collision avoidance
--------------------------------

TODO description

### Dependencies

This demo requires source built of dependencies found in:
- [franka.repos](../franka.repos)
- [control.repos](../control.repos)
- [agimus_dev.repos](../agimus_dev.repos)

### Simulation

> [!NOTE]
> Gazebo simulation of Franka robots require very high frequency of the simulated environment, hence users might experience high CPU utilization or even errors in cases where older and less powerful computers are used.

To launch the demo run:

```bash
ros2 launch agimus_demo_08_collision_avoidance bringup.launch.py use_gazebo:=true use_rviz:=true
```
Expected result: TODO so far nothing...

### Real robot

First turn on the robot and unlock joint in the web-ui. Move the robot a safe position allowing for a full range of joint motion while avoiding collisions with environment and not posing any threat to safety of people around.

> [!CAUTION]
> Before starting the launch file make sure robot is in a safe position and has sufficient movement space for it's joints and is not likely to collide with anything. Ensure all spectators are in a safe distance from the machine, and **the operator can quickly reach the Emergency Button in case error occurs**!

> [!NOTE]
> Robot will start oscillating around it's starting point. When restarting the demo make sure robot was stopped with sufficient joint motion left, as during a re-run it might trigger joint limit safety!

Launch the demo

```bash
ros2 launch agimus_demo_08_collision_avoidance bringup.launch.py robot_ip:=<robot-ip> use_rviz:=true
```
Expected result: Robot moving left and right with a helmet as an obstacle coming from motion capture.
